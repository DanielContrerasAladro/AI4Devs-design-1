## Prompt 1
We are LTI, a software company specialised in developing SaaS and PaaS for SMEs.  Some of our existing clients have expressed an interest in an Applicant Tracking System â€” some of them are unhappy with the ones they are using, and some of them don't use any specialised software for this task today.
You are an experienced business developer / product owner with extensive knowledge of the ATS market and the needs of SMEs. I am the CEO of LTI and am now sitting down with you to start this project. The goal for today is to go from nothing to a broad system design that we can present to the CTO.
First: give me a list of the 10-15 most important features of _existing_ ATS SaaS offerings. Order the features from most important to least important.

## Prompt 2
Thanks. I'm surprised to see _Job posting and distribution_ topping the list. Why is that more important than items 2, 3 and 5, which in my experience can be a lot of work?

## Prompt 3
You said \"historically\" and I think that might be a key word. In the last couple of years we've been in an economic downturn (do you agree?) and most job postings have been bombarded with applications in a very short time. Do you have any experience or data about the last couple of years?

## Prompt 4
I like the updated list a lot but I can't help noticing that it only has 14 items compared to the original 15. What's missing?

## Prompt 4
Wonderful! So now we have a prioritised list of features if we want to build something similar to what is offered today. Using your experience and knowledge of recruitment trends and technological advances (e.g. AI), what are some _new_ features that we could add, and what are some features that could stand to be updated?

## Prompt 5
Sure, give me a broad system architecture!

## Prompt 5
Can you output the diagram as mermaid JS?

## Prompt 5
Add a Lean Canvas diagram to understand the business model

## Prompt 6
Sorry, I meant, please _generate_ a Lean Canvas diagram. Separately.

## Prompt 7
Can you make it look more like a traditional LC diagram? See here for an example: https://www.leanfoundry.com/articles/what-is-lean-canvas
If Mermaid is limiting, propose some other tool.

## Prompt 8
OK, let's use plantuml. Can you regenerate the diagram, adhering strictly to the layout of the example I gave you before?

## Prompt 8
Still not what I want. How about you generate HTML (with CSS in the file) for this template: https://litslink.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/google-lean-canvas-model-1.png

## Prompt 9
OK, I'm going to try some other tool. Of the OpenAI LLMs, available to me, which one is most probable to generate an HTML version of that table?

## Prompt 10
I don't know what 4 Turbo is. I have 4o, 4, 4.5 (that's you), 3-mini-high (which says it's \"great at coding and logic\")

## Prompt 10
What do you mean you're currently using GPT-4? It says right here it's using GPT-4.5.

## Prompt 11
OK, then generate a self-contained HTML file that looks as close as possible to this image.

## Prompt 12
I've created a lean canvas as html (referenced). Can you read it and list the 12 headings here?

## Prompt 13
I like your suggestions, but we need terser language so that it fits in the template. Can you boil down the content you have and rehash it for me here?

## Prompt 13
I need you to combine the things we already agreed on with your new suggestions, and then distill that so that it's fits in the template.
